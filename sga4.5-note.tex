\section*{Typesetters note}

This is a \LaTeX{} rendition of Deligne et.~al.'s \emph{Cohomologie \'Etale}, Lecture 
Notes in Mathematics, 569, Springer-Verlag. The source code may be found at 
GitHub (\url{https://www.github.com/dkmiller/sga4.5}). It is an essentially 
unmodified version of the original. Most changes are slight, e.g. using 
script instead of roman letters for sheaves. The biggest is that 
$\Hom$ is used to denote ``sheaf hom,'' and $\rHom$ its derived functor, while 
$\rhom$ is used to denote the derived functor of the regular hom-functor. Any 
comments or corrections should be sent to \url{dkmiller@math.cornell.edu}.
